# Exercises
In this repository I will be adding simple exercises that I am doing to learn skills, to practice and to identify my limitations. This will help me in tackling my weaknesses during my learning process.
<br><br>

### Odd or even.py

<br>
Is an automatic generator that will answer if a number that the user input is even or odd.<br><br>

### To-do List.py

<br>
Quite straightforward, it is a to-do list that starts with a few items, the user should be able to add or remove items. <br>
But I had trouble with that one, will revisit later. UPDATE: Now it works properly <br><br>

### Files named "Reto __.py"

<br>
Is a series of challenges I took from Elyca's homework - Sorry, girl! - it was great at making me think of a solution and, once solved, how could I improve. <br>
